Introduction to the Meetup-Users Meetup
====
Dear fellow Meetup-user,

Welcome to the Meetup-Users Meetup! The Meetup-Users Meetup is a place to meet other Meetup-users face-to-face at meetups, as if you couldn't already do that with any other Meetup group. Congratulations on joining this frivolous buzzword-tagged Meetup group.

The Meetup-Users Meetup nominally does not include any particular sort of person (because all members of any meetup on Meetup use Meetup and are thus Meetup-users), but you can expect to meet other people who enjoy futile meta nonsensical shenanigans at Meetup-Users Meetup meetups.

I suggested meeting for drinks at a bar as our first meetup to meet the group's theme of false specificity; meeting for drinks is the most generic meetup activity I could think of. Feel free to suggest interesting meetups for future Meetup-Users Meetup meetups as well.

See you on June 7 at our first Meetup-Users Meetup meetup! I'll update you when I find a place to meet up.

Tom
