Introduction to the Meetup Users Meetup
====
Dear fellow Meetup-user,

The Meetup Users Meetup is a place to meet Meetup-users users face-to-face, as if you couldn't already do that with any other Meetup group. Congratulations on joining this frivolous buzzword-tagged group.

While this group nominally does not include any particular sort of person (because all members of any meetup on Meetup use Meetup and are thus Meetup-users), I suspect that this group will attract people who enjoy various futile meta nonsensical shenanigans.

I suggested meeting for drinks at a bar as our first meetup to meet the group's theme of false specificity; it is the most bland, generic and common meetup activity I could think of, but feel free to suggest interesting meetups for future Meetup Users Meetup meetups as well.

See you on June 7 at our first Meetup Users Meetup meetup! And I'll update you when I find a place to meet up.

Cheers!
