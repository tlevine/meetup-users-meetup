The Meetup Users Meetup is a place to meet Meetup-users users face-to-face,
as if you couldn't already do that with any other Meetup group.
Congratulations on joining this frivolous buzzword-tagged group.

While this group nominally does not include any particular sort of person
(because all Meetup users use Meetup), I suspect that this group will attract
people who enjoy various futile meta nonsensical shenanigans.

I suggested drinks at a bar as our first meetup to go with the group's
theme of false specificity; it is the most bland, generic and common activity
I could think of, but feel free to suggest interesting things as well.

See you on June 7! I'll update you when I find a place.

Cheers!
