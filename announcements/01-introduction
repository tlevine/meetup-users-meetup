In the Meetup Users Meetup, you will make interesting, relevant,
fun and otherwise good connections. Congratulations on joining this
frivolous buzzword-tagged group.

I suggested drinks at a bar because that is sort of the most bland,
generic and common meetup I could think of, but feel free to suggest
interesting things as well; while this group nominally does not
include any particular sort of person (because all Meetup users use
Meetup), I suspect that this group will enjoy various futile meta
nonsensical shenanigans.

In the mean time, I'll work on finding a bar for June 7.

Cheers!
